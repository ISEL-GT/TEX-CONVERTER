## FILE TO TEX CONVERTER

### Summary
> This program takes any given source and converts it into a `.tex` compatible file, to be included in LaTEX projects.

---

### Usage
Firstly, download the [tex-converter.exe](https://github.com/ISEL-GT/TEX-CONVERTER/releases) file from the downloads page. Afterwards, run the following command (basic usage):

```
$ java -jar tex-converter-jar --source /path/to/source/directory --output /path/to/output/directory
```
This program will convert every file in the source directory, copying its relative location to the source and outputting a replica of the source directory structure with the converted files.

---

### Warning:
⚠️ **IMPORTANT** ⚠️ - You **must** include the `vhdl_libraries.tex` file in your Overleaf project for proper compilation. This file contains the necessary settings and libraries for the LaTeX code to be processed correctly. Without it, the LaTeX files generated by this converter might not compile as expected.

---

#### Options:

- `--source <path>`: Path to the source directory (defaults to the current working directory).
- `--output <path>`: Path to the output directory where the converted `.tex` files will be saved (defaults to `./out/`).
- `--filter <extension>`: Optionally specify a file extension to filter the files to convert (e.g., `--filter vhdl` to only convert `.vhdl` files).
- `--overleaf-path <path>`: Path where the LaTeX files will be included from in Overleaf (defaults to `vhdl/`).

The converter will then generate `.tex` files for each file in the source directory, and you will be able to include them in your LaTeX project.

**NOTE:** 
- The `--filter` option is used to specify which file extensions should be converted. If not provided, all file types will be considered.
- The `--overleaf-path` option helps adjust the inclusion path for Overleaf projects.

If not specified, the default values will be used:
- `--source` defaults to the current working directory.
- `--output` defaults to `./out/`.
- `--filter` defaults to no filter (all files are considered).
- `--overleaf-path` defaults to `vhdl/`.
